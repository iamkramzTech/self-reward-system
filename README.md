   - Solving a complex problem or bug.
   - Consistently waking up on time for a week.

### 2. Define Rewards
   Assign rewards to each milestone based on its difficulty or importance.
   
   **Examples:**
   - **Small milestones:** Enjoy your favorite snack, watch a short episode of a series.
   - **Medium milestones:** Buy a new gadget accessory, have a fancy meal.
   - **Major milestones:** Treat yourself to a weekend getaway, upgrade your setup (new monitor, keyboard, etc.).

### 3. Set Clear Rules
   - Stick to the rules you create to maintain discipline.
   - Only give yourself the reward after completing the milestone.
