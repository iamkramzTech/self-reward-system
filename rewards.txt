Creating a self-reward system is a great way to stay motivated and acknowledge your achievements. Here's a simple framework you can use:

### 1. **Identify Milestones**
   - Break down your goals into smaller, achievable milestones.
   - Examples:
     - Completing a project module.
     - Learning a new framework or tool.
     - Solving a complex problem or bug.
     - Consistently waking up on time for a week.

### 2. **Define Rewards**
   - Assign rewards to each milestone based on its difficulty or importance.
   - Examples:
     - Small milestones: Enjoy your favorite snack, watch a short episode of a series.
     - Medium milestones: Buy a new gadget accessory, have a fancy meal.
     - Major milestones: Treat yourself to a weekend getaway, upgrade your setup (new monitor, keyboard, etc.).

### 3. **Set Clear Rules**
   - Stick to the rules you create to maintain discipline.
   - Only give yourself the reward after completing the milestone.

### 4. **Track Progress**
   - Use a planner, app, or spreadsheet to monitor milestones and rewards.
   - Reflect on your achievements and how the rewards positively impact your motivation.
